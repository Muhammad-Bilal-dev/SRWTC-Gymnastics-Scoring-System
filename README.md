# SRWTC-Gymnastics-Scoring-System
A real-time scoring system for SRWTC gymnastics events. Judges can input scores for each gymnast, with automatic storage in Google Sheets. If a score for the same gymnast number exists, the system offers a rewrite option. A dedicated subdomain displays live overall results for all gymnasts, ensuring transparency and easy access during competitions.
